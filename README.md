# BlockChain-Patents
Project that will use smart contract technology to keep patents avaiable in a blockchain system   

# How patents work:
Patents, first and foremost, are an exclusive right granted for an invention. In other words, a patent is an exclusive right to a product or a process that generally provides a new way of doing something, or offers a new technical solution to a problem. To get a patent, technical information about the invention must be disclosed to the public in a patent application.

To get a patent to be considered valid, a number of conditions should be met, and some conditions depend on the country where you are filing a patent request. Someof the key conditions respect below requirements:

* The invention must show an element of novelty; that is, some new characteristic which is not known in the body of existing knowledge in  its technical field. This body of existing knowledge is called “prior art”.
* The invention must involve an “inventive step” or “non-obvious”, which means that it could not be obviously deduced by a person having ordinary skill in the relevant technical field.
* The invention must be capable of industrial application, meaning that it must be capable of being used for an industrial or business purpose beyond a mere theoretical phenomenon, or be useful.
* Its subject matter must be accepted as “patentable” under law. In many countries, scientific theories, aesthetic creations, mathematical methods, plant or animal varieties, discoveries of natural substances, commercial methods, methods for medical treatment (as opposed to medical products) or computer programs are generally not patentable.
The invention must be disclosed in an application in a manner sufficiently clear and complete to enable it to be replicated by a person with an ordinary level of skill in the relevant technical field.

Once an applicant believes it has all of the requirements met, the applicant must submit a request for issuing a patent in a patent office, which conducts the issuing process, which can take up to 18 months to be completed and available to the general public for consulting.

Patents usually lasts for 20 years. After a Patent expires, it becomes permanently available for anyone to use its technologies described, free of legal issues or charges.

As mentioned above, each country deals with its own patent system, and although there are countries that are memebers of international patent offices (regional offices), theres not a worldwide patent office.


# Why use blockchain technology to build an universal patent system:
Imagine that you create or discover an easier and revolutionary way to do your work, and you want to register it as a patent. Often, there is no good and safe way to catalogue your work: in UK for example, copyright is unregistered. In that case, some important consequences are:

* Ownership can be hard to prove
* It is difficult to keep track of who is using your patent
* It is also difficult for someone who wants to use a patent to find its owner
* Infringments are hard to contain
* Monetising rights can be easily harmed with a lot of works that were based on the original

In resume, it is not easy to register a patent, and consulting the original work can be hard too. Builiding the patent system in a blockchain, with smart contrats, can put an end to all problems described above in this session. Putting a patent in the blockchain means that nobody can change or destroy the document information: **This is because a blockchain transaction is immutable**.

Beyond that, anyone can check when and who putted the document in the blockchain system, and keep track on how the work is being used. That means that the author can see who is using his work, and if the work is being used correctly, without infringments. With the blockchain system, transactions between clients and author can be made by a direct link, wich means that more people will actually pay for using other's work.

This is great! But there is one last problem to solve: **Who created the patent first?** There are cases where more than one author creates a great solution to the same problem, with close approach. In that case, depositing a copy of the creation at a notary can work. The blockchain system can check at that service the official date of two or more documents. Those services will not keep the document itself, only the reference of a document a it release's date.

With this strategy, our work seek to build a blockchain system that can solve the patent's world problem.
