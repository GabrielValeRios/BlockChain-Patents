# How patents work:
Patents, first and foremost, are an exclusive right granted for an invention. In other words, a patent is an exclusive right to a product or a process that generally provides a new way of doing something, or offers a new technical solution to a problem. To get a patent, technical information about the invention must be disclosed to the public in a patent application.

To get a patent to be considered valid, a number of conditions should be met, and some conditions depend on the country where you are filing a patent request. Someof the key conditions respect below requirements:

* The invention must show an element of novelty; that is, some new characteristic which is not known in the body of existing knowledge in  its technical field. This body of existing knowledge is called “prior art”.
* The invention must involve an “inventive step” or “non-obvious”, which means that it could not be obviously deduced by a person having ordinary skill in the relevant technical field.
* The invention must be capable of industrial application, meaning that it must be capable of being used for an industrial or business purpose beyond a mere theoretical phenomenon, or be useful.
* Its subject matter must be accepted as “patentable” under law. In many countries, scientific theories, aesthetic creations, mathematical methods, plant or animal varieties, discoveries of natural substances, commercial methods, methods for medical treatment (as opposed to medical products) or computer programs are generally not patentable.
The invention must be disclosed in an application in a manner sufficiently clear and complete to enable it to be replicated by a person with an ordinary level of skill in the relevant technical field.

Once an applicant believes it has all of the requirements met, the applicant must submit a request for issuing a patent in a patent office, which conducts the issuing process, which can take up to 18 months to be completed and available to the general public for consulting.

Patents usually lasts for 20 years. After a Patent expires, it becomes permanently available for anyone to use its technologies described, free of legal issues or charges.

As mentioned above, each country deals with its own patent system, and although there are countries that are memebers of international patent offices (regional offices), theres not a worldwide patent office.
